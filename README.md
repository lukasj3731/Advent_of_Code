# Advent_of_Code

These are my solutions to Advent of code, an online puzzle series coming up every december.

## 2019
first year I participated, my solutions are saved as .pde files, which can be run in Processing 3.
You can look at my puzzle input and paste in your own input if you want your solutions.
All files are running independently, so every .pde will work completely on it's own. 
most puzzles will be solved like this:
```
Task 1: <solution 1>
Task 2: <solution 2>
```
but some won't cause I was too lazy to extract the solution as text. all solutions will still be human readable though.
