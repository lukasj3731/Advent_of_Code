# Advent_of_Code

These are my solutions to Advent of code, an online puzzle series coming up every december.

## 2019
First year I participated, my solutions are saved as .pde files, which can be run in Processing 3.
You can look at my puzzle input and paste in your own input if you want your solutions.
All files are running independently, so every .pde will work completely on it's own. 
Most puzzles will be solved like this:
```
Task 1: <solution 1>
Task 2: <solution 2>
```
but some won't cause I was too lazy to extract the solution as text. all solutions will still be human readable though.

## 2020
Second year, this time I'm using regular java. I'm kinda having a go at Codegolf, although I still use semi-readable names and spacing. The class AOC is full of helper methods that I thought would be generally useful, and the AOC `main()` will run every day and print the solution.
Puzzle inputs are stored at `inputs/input<day>.txt`
As last year, all puzzles will be solved like this:
```
Task 1: <solution 1>
Task 2: <solution 2>
```

## 2018
I'm trying to learn python! I'm just getting started, so don't expenct a lot. every day is it's own python program, named ```day<day>.py```in the ```src``` folder. All inputs are in the ```inputs``` folder. Every day prints the solution like this:
```
Task 1: <solution 1>
Task 2: <solution 2>
```

## 2017
Still improving at python! This year I've structured everything a bit different, which makes reading in puts a lot cleaner. input files are still in the ```inputs``` folder. Instead of having to start each day manually (like my solution for 2018), the ```main.py``` takes care of everything by calling the function ```solve<day>()``` in every corresponding ```day<day>.py```. Outputs are printed as:
```
task 1: <solution 1>
task 2: <solution 2>
```

## 2016
Getting good at python! Tried to improve further and get more comfortable with the language, and I think I succeded. very similarly to last year, the ```main.py``` takes care of running everything and just the files in the ```inputs``` folder need to be adjusted for your inputs. All outputs are printed as:
```
Task 1: <solution 1>
Task 2: <solution 2>
```

## 2015
Getting very comfy with python! I'm experimenting further while still building on top of the same structure as the previous years. inputs are in the ```inputs``` folder.
instead of short code I'm trying to optimize for runtime this year, but all the outputs will still be printed as:
```
Task 1: <solution 1>
Task 2: <solution 2>
```
