# Advent_of_Code

These are my solutions to Advent of code, an online puzzle series coming up every december.

## 2019
First year I participated, my solutions are saved as .pde files, which can be run in Processing 3.
You can look at my puzzle input and paste in your own input if you want your solutions.
All files are running independently, so every .pde will work completely on it's own. 
Most puzzles will be solved like this:
```
Task 1: <solution 1>
Task 2: <solution 2>
```
but some won't cause I was too lazy to extract the solution as text. all solutions will still be human readable though.

## 2020
Second year, this time I'm using regular java. I'm kinda having a go at Codegolf, although I still use semi-readable names and spacing. The class AOC is full of helper methods that I thought would be generally useful, and the AOC `main()` will run every day and print the solution if possible.
Puzzle inputs are stored at `inputs/input<day>.txt`
As last year, most puzzles will be solved like this:
```
Task 1: <solution>
Task 2: <solution>
```
